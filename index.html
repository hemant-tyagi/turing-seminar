		<b>Title</b>:  Topological Methods for Molecular Phylogenetics
				</p>
				
		<p class="tab">
			<b>Abstract</b>: The recent explosion of genomic data has underscored the need for interpretable and comprehensive analyses that can capture complex phylogenetic relations within and across species. Recombination, re-assortment and horizontal gene transfer constitute examples of pervasive biological phenomena that cannot be captured by tree-like representations. Starting from hundreds of genomes, we are interested in the reconstruction of potential evolutionary histories leading to the observed data. Recently, topological data analysis methods have been proposed as robust and scalable methods that can capture the genetic scale and frequency of recombination. In this talk I will discuss recent developments in the study of recombination using persistent homology, and I will present several biological applications, including the construction of high-resolution whole-genome human recombination maps.

						<b> Title </b>:  Minimal Morse Functions via the Heat Equation in Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds
						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">
						<b>Abstract</b>:
							Let \((M,g)\) be a  closed  Riemannian  manifold that is homogeneous,  in the sense that each pair of points have mutually isometric neighborhoods,  and let \(\Delta_ g\) be its Laplace-Beltrami operator.  The heat equation on \((M,g)\) is \[\frac{df}{dt}=-\Delta_g(f)\] and for each initial
							condition \(u\) in \(L^2(M)\) there exists a unique solution \(f_t(.):=f(.,t)\) satisfying   \(f_0=u\).  It has been observed in several examples that for generic \(u\) and large enough \(t\),  \(f_t\)  is a Morse function having the least number of critical points admitted by any Morse function on \(M\).
							In this talk I will quickly review the definitions and facts necessary to state the previous observation as a formal conjecture, and then I will mention the examples that have been  tested so far.
