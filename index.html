						<b> Title </b>: Reservoir Computing (RC). Part I: RC paradigm and universal approximation properties of RC systems.
 
						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: A relatively recent family of dynamic machine learning paradigms known collectively as reservoir computing is presented which is capable of unprecedented performances in the forecasting of deterministic and stochastic processes. We then focus on the universal approximation properties of the most widely used families of reservoir computers in applications. These results are a much awaited generalization to the dynamic
context of previous well-known static results obtained in the context of neural networks. The universal approximation properties with respect to L^\infty  and L^p -type criteria of three important families of reservoir computers with stochastic discrete-time semi-infinite inputs are shown. First, it is proved that linear reservoir systems with either polynomial or neural network readout maps are universal. More importantly, it is proved that the same property holds for two families with linear readouts, namely, state-afine systems and echo state networks. The linearity in the readouts is a key feature in supervised machine learning applications. It guarantees that these systems can be used in high-dimensional situations and in the presence of large datasets.

						<b> Title </b>: Reservoir Computing (RC). Part II: Applicability of RC systems with unbounded inputs and their empirical performance.
 

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: We show an extension of the results presented in the previous talk to unbounded inputs which is a particularly natural setup for stochastic signals. We complement the universality results with an empirical assessment of performance in applications to time series forecasting. In particular, we focus on predicting financial realized covariance matrices which is a question of much importance for practitioners and researchers. We examine the empirical performance of RC in comparison with many conventional state-of-the-art econometric models for various realized covariance estimators, periods, and dimensions. We show that universal RC families consistently demonstrate superior predictive ability for various empirical designs. We conclude the presentation outlining the work in progress and future lines of research.

						<b> Title </b>: Isotonic regression in general dimensions
 

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: We study the least squares regression function estimator over the class of real-valued functions on [0,1]^d that are increasing in each coordinate.  For uniformly bounded signals and with a fixed, cubic lattice design, we establish that the estimator achieves the minimax rate of order n^{-min(2/(d+2),1/d)} in the empirical L_2 loss, up to poly-logarithmic factors.  Further, we prove a sharp oracle inequality, which reveals in particular that when the true regression function is piecewise constant on k hyperrectangles, the least squares estimator enjoys a faster, adaptive rate of convergence of (k/n)^{min(1,2/d)}, again up to poly-logarithmic factors.  Previous results are confined to the case d \leq 2.  Finally, we establish corresponding bounds (which are new even in the case d=2) in the more challenging random design setting.  There are two surprising features of these results: first, they demonstrate that it is possible for a global empirical risk minimisation procedure to be rate optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors even when the corresponding entropy integral for the function class diverges rapidly; second, they indicate that the adaptation rate for shape-constrained estimators can be strictly worse than the parametric rate.

						<b> Title </b>: Nonparametric estimation of infinite order regression and its application to finance.
 

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>:  In this walk, we study nonparametric estimation of the infinite order regression with stationary and weakly dependent data. We propose a Nadaraya-Watson type estimator that operates with an infinite number of conditioning variables. We propose a bandwidth sequence that shrinks the effects of long lags, so the influence of all conditioning information is modelled in a natural and flexible way, and the econometric issues of omitted information bias and specification error are effectively handled. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimator under a wide range of static and dynamic regressions framework, thereby allowing various kinds of conditioning variables to  be used. We establish pointwise/uniform consistency and the CLTs. We show that the convergence rates are at best logarithmic, and depend on the smoothness of the regression, the distribution of the marginal regressors and their dependence structure in a non-trivial way via the Lambert W function. As an application, the proposed theory is applied to investigate an important question in finance. We report some new empirical evidence on the dynamics of risk-return relation over time and its link with the macroeconomy, and also add supporting evidence for explaining some major puzzles in finance.

						<b> Title </b>: Doubly Robust Bayesian Inference for Non-Stationary Streaming Data with beta-Divergences
 						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: We present the first robust Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection algorithm through General Bayesian Inference (GBI) with beta-divergences. The resulting inference procedure is doubly robust for both the parameter and the changepoint (CP) posterior, with linear time and constant space complexity. We provide a construction for exponential models and demonstrate it on the Bayesian Linear Regression model. In so doing, we make two additional contributions: Firstly, we make GBI scalable using Structural Variational approximations that are exact as beta goes to 0. Secondly, we give a principled way of choosing the divergence parameter beta by minimizing expected predictive loss on-line. Reducing False Discovery Rates of CPs from over 90% to 0% on real world data, this offers the state of the art.

						<b> Title </b>: A General Theory for Large-Scale Curve Time Series via Functional Stability Measure
 

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: Modelling a large bundle of curves arises in a broad spectrum of real applications. However, 
							existing literature relies primarily on the critical assumption of independent curve observations. 
							In this talk, we provide a general theory for large-scale Gaussian curve time series, where the temporal 
							and cross-sectional dependence across multiple curve observations exist and the number of functional variables, 
							p,  may be large relative to the number of observations, n.  We propose a novel functional stability measure 
							for multivariate stationary processes based on their spectral properties and use it to establish some useful 
							concentration bounds on the sample covariance matrix function. These concentration bounds serve as a 
							fundamental tool for further theoretical analysis, in particular, for deriving nonasymptotic upper bounds 
							on the errors of the regularized estimates in high dimensional settings. As functional principle component 
							analysis (FPCA) is one of the key techniques to handle functional data, we also investigate the concentration 
							properties of the relevant estimated terms under a FPCA framework. To illustrate with an important application,
							we consider vector functional autoregressive models and develop a regularization approach to estimate 
							autoregressive coefficient functions under the sparsity constraint. Using our derived nonasymptotic results,
							we investigate the theoretical properties of the regularized estimate in a "large p,  small n" regime. The 
							finite sample performance of the proposed method is examined through simulation studies.

						<b> Title </b>: Testing for High-Dimensional White Noise
 

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: Testing for white noise is a classical yet important problem in statistics, especially for diagnostic checks in time series modeling and linear regression. For high-dimensional time series in the sense that the dimension p is large in relation to the sample size T, the popular omnibus tests including the multivariate Hosking and Li-McLeod tests are extremely conservative, leading to substantial power loss. To develop more relevant tests for high-dimensional cases, we propose a portmanteau-type test statistic which is the sum of squared singular values of the first q lagged sample autocovariance matrices. It, therefore, encapsulates all the serial correlations (upto the time lag q)
within and across all component series. Using the tools from random matrix theory and assuming both p and T diverge to infinity, we derive the asymptotic normality of the test statistic under both the null and a specific VMA(1) alternative hypothesis. As the actual implementation of the test requires the knowledge of three characteristic constants of the population cross-sectional covariance matrix and the value of the fourth moment of the standardized innovations, non-trivial estimations are proposed for these parameters and their integration leads to a practically usable test. Extensive simulation confirms the excellent finite-sample performance of the new test with accurate size and satisfactory power for a large range of finite (p, T) combinations, therefore ensuring wide applicability in practice. We also talk about alternative tests using maximal correlations. Results can be used even for nonlinear processes and non-iid data.

						<b> Title </b>: Learning Quadratic Games on Networks
 

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: Individuals, or organisations, cooperate with or compete against one another in 
a wide range of practical situations. In the economics literature, such strategic 
interactions are often modelled as games played on networks, where an 
individual's payoff depends not only on her action but also that of her neighbours. 
The current literature has largely focused on analysing the characteristics of 
network games in the scenario where the structure of the network, which is 
represented by a graph, is known beforehand. It is often the case, however, 
that the actions of the players are readily observable while the underlying 
interaction network remains hidden. In this talk, I will introduce two novel 
frameworks for learning, from the observations on individual actions, network 
games with linear-quadratic payoffs, and in particular the structure of the 
interaction network. Both frameworks are based on the Nash equilibrium of 
such games and involve solving a joint optimisation problem for the graph 
structure and the individual marginal benefits. We test the proposed frameworks 
on both synthetic and real world examples, and show that they can effectively 
and more accurately learn the games than the baselines. The proposed 
approach has both theoretical and practical implications for understanding 
strategic interactions in a network environment.
