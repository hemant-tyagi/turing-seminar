				This seminar aims to provide a regular forum at the <a href="http://turing.ac.uk">Alan

				beyond heuristics to abstract foundations and/or algorithms with provable guarantees; we
				encourage a specific focus on proofs rather than validation, and on explicit complexity bounds 
				over trial-and-error techniques.

						<b>Abstract</b>: Change points are a very common feature of big data that arrive in the form of a data stream. We study high dimensional time series in which, at certain time points, the mean structure changes in a sparse subset of the co-ordinates. The challenge is to borrow strength across the co-ordinates to detect smaller changes than could be observed in any individual component series. We propose a two-stage procedure called 'inspect' for estimation of the change points: first, we argue that a good projection direction can be obtained as the leading left singular vector of the matrix that solves a convex optimization problem derived from the cumulative sum transformation of the time series. We then apply an existing univariate change point estimation algorithm to the projected series. Our theory provides strong guarantees on both the number of estimated change points and the rates of convergence of their locations, and our numerical studies validate its highly competitive empirical performance for a wide range of data-generating mechanisms. Software implementing the methodology is available in the R package 'InspectChangepoint'.

						<b> Title </b>:  Bandit Optimization with Upper-Confidence Frank-Wolfe

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: We consider the problem of bandit optimization, inspired by stochastic optimization and online learning problems with bandit feedback. In this problem, the objective is to minimize a global loss function of all the actions, not necessarily a cumulative loss. This framework allows us to study a very general class of problems, with applications in statistics, machine learning, and other fields. To solve this problem, we introduce the Upper-Confidence Frank-Wolfe algorithm, inspired by techniques for bandits and convex optimization. We show upper bounds on the optimization error of this algorithm over various classes of functions, and discuss the optimality of these results.
