						<b> Title </b>: High dimensional change point estimation via sparse projection 
 

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: Change points are a very common feature of big data that arrive in the form of a data stream. We study high dimensional time series in which, at certain time points, the mean structure changes in a sparse subset of the co-ordinates. The challenge is to borrow strength across the co-ordinates to detect smaller changes than could be observed in any individual component series. We propose a two-stage procedure called 'inspect' for estimation of the change points: first, we argue that a good projection direction can be obtained as the leading left singular vector of the matrix that solves a convex optimization problem derived from the cumulative sum transformation of the time series. We then apply an existing univariate change point estimation algorithm to the projected series. Our theory provides strong guarantees on both the number of estimated change points and the rates of convergence of their locations, and our numerical studies validate its highly competitive empirical performance for a wide range of data-generating mechanisms. Software implementing the methodology is available in the R package 'InspectChangepoint'.

						<b> Title </b>:  From which world is your graph?

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">
						<b>Abstract</b>: Discovering statistical structure from links is a fundamental problem in the analysis of social networks. Choosing a misspecified model, or equivalently, an incorrect inference algorithm will result in an invalid analysis or even falsely uncover patterns that are in fact artifacts of the model. This work focuses on unifying two of the most widely used link-formation 
models: the stochastic blockmodel (SBM) and the small world (or latent space) model (SWM). Integrating techniques from kernel learning, spectral graph theory, and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, we develop the first statistically sound polynomial-time algorithm to discover latent patterns in sparse graphs for both models. When the network comes from an SBM, the algorithm outputs a block structure. When it is from an SWM, the algorithm outputs estimates of each node's latent position. We report experiments performed on a twitter dataset collected between October and November 2016. Based on joint work with Cheng Li, Zhenming Liu and Felix Wong.

						<b> Title </b>:  Bandit Optimization with Upper-Confidence Frank-Wolfe

						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: We consider the problem of bandit optimization, inspired by stochastic optimization and online learning problems with bandit feedback. In this problem, the objective is to minimize a global loss function of all the actions, not necessarily a cumulative loss. This framework allows us to study a very general class of problems, with applications in statistics, machine learning, and other fields. To solve this problem, we introduce the Upper-Confidence Frank-Wolfe algorithm, inspired by techniques for bandits and convex optimization. We show upper bounds on the optimization error of this algorithm over various classes of functions, and discuss the optimality of these results.

						<b> Title </b>:  The xyz algorithm for fast interaction search in high-dimensional data


						</p>
						
						<p class = "tab">

						<b>Abstract</b>: When performing regression on a dataset with p variables, it is often of interest to go beyond using main effects and include interactions as products between individual variables. However, if the number of variables p is large, as is common in genomic datasets, the computational cost of searching through O(p^2) interactions can be prohibitive. In this talk I will introduce a new randomised algorithm called xyz that is able to discover interactions with high probability and under mild conditions has a runtime that is subquadratic in p. The underlying idea is to transform interaction search into a much simpler closest pair problem. We will see how strong interactions can be discovered in almost linear time, whilst finding weaker interactions requires O(p^u) operations for 1 < u < 2 depending on their strength. An application of xyz to a genome-wide association study shows how more than 10^11 interactions can be screened in minutes using a standard laptop. This is joint work with Gian Thanei and Nicolai Meinshausen (ETH Zurich).
